    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Pizza Though</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Garlic Oil</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Pizza toppings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar
        in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy
        foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away
        from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead
        until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and
        cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
        Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more
        hour, or until doubled again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic
        in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an
        oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to
        puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn
        dough over using two spatulas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust; then top with 1/2 of each
        of the following: tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, olives, red peppers,
        cheese, and basil. Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove
        from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second
        piece of dough.
      </li>
    </ol>
